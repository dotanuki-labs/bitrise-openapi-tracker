#  Bitrise REST API tracker ðŸ¤–

## What

A companion automation to track changes on [Bitrise REST API](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/api/api-reference.html).

## How

Changes are tracked on top of [bump.sh](https://bump.sh/), one of the best tools out there to create outstanding API docs from OpenAPI specs.

> Disclaimer : I'm not sponsored by this tool ðŸ’¸

`bump.sh` offers a nice feature where diffs between deploys are tracked in a changelog fashion. This is useful for ever-evolving API usually generated automatically and not necessarily properly versioned.

This automation will do a dailly check Bitrise OpenAPI reference and

- Deploy changes on `bump.sh`, if any
- Update the spec itself in this repo
