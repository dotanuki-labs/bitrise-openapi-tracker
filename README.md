#  Bitrise REST API tracker ðŸ¤–

## What

A companion automation to track changes on [Bitrise REST API](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/api/api-reference.html).

## How

Changes are tracked no top of [bump.sh](https://bump.sh/), one of the best tools in the market to create outstanding API docs from OpenAPI specs.

> Disclaimer : I'm not sponsored by this tool

`bump.sh` offers a nice feature where diffs between OpenAPI fiels are tracked in a changelog-like fashion. This is useful for ever-evolving API generated automatically by the underlying tooling where not necessarily we have updates properly versioned in the spec itself.

This automation will do a dailly check Bitrise OpenAPI reference and

- Deploy changes on `bump.sh`
- Update the spec itself in this repo
